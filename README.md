# Fix32 V0.3

Easy implementation of fixed point numbers in Rust, using i32 as base. Decimal places should be configured at compile time, to be able to optimize the code at max. This is a personal project and is meant to keep it clear and easily understandable. Anyone can commit improvements or extra characrterisitcs, but all of them have to be clearly explained for a non proffesional programmer. I will not add any code I don't understand.

## Considerations on internal maths

All the operations that convert from float types to int will truncate value instead of roinding.

## Considerations on version numbering

Mayor number in verion will lock all the features that it has and works. Minor version number will imply improvements on the code or bug corrections, but no new features.

# Features for V1

* i32 based fixed point struct
* Creation from basic tipes (i32, i64, f32, f64), new with 0 value and direcyly setting internal i32 value.
* Get value in basic types and String.
* Basic operator overloading: (+,-,*,/,%,comparing operators and their asign counterparts)
* Basic math functions:
  * Get remainder as i32.
  * Truncate internal decimals (changing self value)
  * Get absolute value.
  * Get powered to 2, 3 or any other positive integer.
* Basic numeric constants and values.

## TODO

### Next version features

* Asign Operators.
* Basic numeric constants and values.

### General

* Find a way to adjust decimal positions on compile time. Â¿Will ever be possible on Rust?
* Code comments for documentation using Cargo Doc.
* Many more tests for everything

### Aid functions

* (Nothing)

## Bugs

* Rounding errors on making power functions or multiple multiplciations if operands are small number with many decimals
